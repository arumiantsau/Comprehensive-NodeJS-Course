## Third Lesson - Event Emitters using node:events

### - Task 1: Understanding EventEmitter Basics
Examine the built-in node:events module and the fundamental concept of Event Emitters in Node.js. Create a simple script that showcases how to create an instance of EventEmitter, attach listeners to events, and emit events.

### - Task 2: Exploring Event-Based File System Monitoring
Dive deeper into the power of event-driven programming by implementing a file monitoring system. Create a script that uses the fs module to watch a specified directory for changes. Whenever a change occurs, emit an event through an EventEmitter to notify your application. Implement event listeners to react to these file system events.
