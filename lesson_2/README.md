## Second Lesson - UDP Protocol

### - Task 1: Simple UDP Communication
Implement a basic UDP client and server communication. Modify the existing client and server code to use UDP instead of TCP. Ensure that the client can send a message to the server, and the server can receive and display the message.

### - Task 2: Broadcast Messaging
Enhance your UDP server to support broadcasting. Allow the client to send a message that will be broadcasted to all connected clients. Implement a mechanism for clients to distinguish between different messages.

### - Task 3: Error Handling and Reliability
Introduce error handling and reliability mechanisms to your UDP communication. Implement acknowledgment messages from the server to the client to ensure reliable message delivery. Handle scenarios where messages may be lost or arrive out of order.
